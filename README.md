## DAO-Managed Pooled Asset Lending Platform

Develop a decentralized platform that allows community members to pool assets and offer under-collateralized loans based on social capital.
Governance and lending decisions will be managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). 

Sanity check of features:

** Borrowing/Lending features **

pool balances of individual and total (require each individual to deposit a minimum or uniform deposit for everyone)
** DAO features **

** User Credibility features **

reputation scores (for now) and adjusting feature
